    <p class="govuk-body">Use this service to find an 'Unclaimed Court Money' account from a civil court in England and Wales.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">An Unclaimed Court Money account could contain money paid to you or awarded by a court, for example to settle a court case. It could also contain money paid or awarded to someone whose <%= govuk_link_to "estate you're entitled to claim", "https://www.gov.uk/unclaimed-estates-bona-vacantia" %>.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you find money you think you could be entitled to, you will need to get more information from the Court Funds Office before you can make a claim.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You must claim money from an account before its last claim date, which is shown in this service. The last claim date is when there has been no activity on an account for 30 years. If you make a claim 12 months or less before the last claim date, you must also tell the Court Funds Office as soon as you make your claim to the court.</p>
